    "### Write a function to calculate a summary statistics of barcode count data\n",
    "Some large-scale functional assays, such as deep mutational scans and massively paraller reporter gene assays, use Illumina sequencing of short DNA or RNA barcodes as the assay readout. The data comes in the form of read counts per barcode. To analyze the data, summary statistics for these barcode counts are calculated across multiple biological replicates (and often across multiple barcodes that tag the same protein variant or reporter gene).\n",
    "\n",
    "Barcode data is often noisy, which can be dealt with in different ways. You can eliminate outliers, as well as undetected barcodes (meaning those with a read count of 0). Some investigators choose to use the mean to summarize the data, while other prefer the median, since it is more robust to outliers and skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, imagine that you are writing a program to process barcode data from deep mutational scans. A program like this would involve multiple components, but today you are working on a function to calculate a summary statistic for barcode counts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, write a function that does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Accepts one argument: a list of barcode count data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Process the list of data by creating a new list that does *not* include any values either greater than 2 (what we'll take as outliers here) or equal to 0. HINT: Use a `for` loop with a conditional statement, or a list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Calculate the average value of the list based on its sum and length.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Returns the average value.\n",

    "**Note:** The barcode data is normalized by total number of reads, and thus mostly falls between zero and one."
